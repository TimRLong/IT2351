Executive Summary

In this assignment, I set up SQL Workbench and learned the basics of database queries by reading the 2nd and 3rd chapters of Murach's MySQL textbook.

MySQL Workbench

I took a relatively straight forward approach to this assignment by following each direction slowly and to the letter. I was able to complete the assignment with relative ease and 
learn what I needed to get started in MySQL Workbench.

Queries

Once I got the database up and running I found typing in the search queries to be a very satisfying and intuitive way of narrowing down the information. 

Conclusion

The only challenge in setting up the workbench came when I attempted to incorporate the additional schemas, but after rereading all the relevant material I fixed the issue.
I look forward to learning more about the capabilities of the program.
