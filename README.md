Executive Summary

In this assignment students will learn about MYSQL stored procedures and functions. 
We will learn how to input parameters and return values.

Stored Programs

1. In this stored procedure I counted the number of products in the products table 
and determined if they surpassed a certain number. Messages were selected based on the 
count.

2. In this stored procedure I inserted a category into a prexisting category table. 
Messages were selected based on whether the category being inserted was accepted or 
rejected as a duplicate. 

3. In this stored function I determined the final price of an item after a discount 
had been applied. A selected item id is input into the function and the final price is 
calculated and returned to the calling program.

Conclusion

I learned how to create message based on if statements, insert new records into a 
table, and how to use a function to calculate a value. I had trouble finding context 
for the placements of my tables, but using your notes was very helpful.
