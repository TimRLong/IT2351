Executive Summary

In this assignment we will use a guitar shop as the blueprint for a database. Utilizing the various tasks that need to be completed by a shop to practice organizing data, and working with customer related tables, order related tables, and product related tables. We will add to our knowledge by incorporating rollup to have summary lines, by copying a table, inserting information, and adding new keywords and functions to our vocabulary.

Query Review

1. A copy of the processes used in Assignment 2.

2. My information is added into the customers table.

3. A table is created and filled using a preexisting table and the new table is displayed.

4. A column in a table is updated to change a specific value to a new value.

5. The Count and Sum keywords are used and the results are given aliases.

6. The number of products within three different categories are taken along with their prices and ordered by count descending and price descending.

7. Two tables are joined to the order_items table and grouped by columns within each of those tables. Rollup is added to add summary lines.

Conclusion

During the course of this assignment I have learned much more about creating queries and organizing information in MySQL.
