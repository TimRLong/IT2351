Executive Summary

In this assignment students will learn about MYSQL stored procedures and functions. We will learn how to input parameters and return values.

Stored Programs

In this stored procedure I counted the number of products in the products table and determined if they surpassed a certain number. Messages were selected based on the count.

In this stored procedure I inserted a category into a prexisting category table. Messages were selected based on whether the category being inserted was accepted or rejected as a duplicate.

In this stored function I determined the final price of an item after a discount had been applied. A selected item id is input into the function and the final price is calculated and returned to the calling program.

Conclusion

I learned how to create message based on if statements, insert new records into a table, and how to use a function to calculate a value. I had trouble finding context for the placements of my tables, but using your notes was very helpful.
